# Reddit Clone With Server

This project is a simple reddit clone with a database backend. I love using reddit, and I thought it would be really cool to build a simple version of it.  It contains most of the essential features of the actual reddit, and it helped give me a better understanding of how to create persistent data web applications.

# Challenges

-This is the first application I built with AngularJS that also has a backend. I had to become comfortable with State, and the Model View Controller design. 

-I found that I really enjoyed using AngularJS, and I did not find it that complicated to use. I liked the way that the app could be organized with components, and view templates.

-Learning the basics of how to make HTTP calls to my server, and retrieve data that users input was a huge breakthrough for me. It helped me connect the bridge between the front-end user interface, and the back-end database.
